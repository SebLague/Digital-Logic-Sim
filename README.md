# Digital-Logic-Sim
A minimalistic digital logic simulator, which I created as part of my video series: [Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq).
<br>You can find the latest builds over [here](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim).<br>

Note: Pull requests are welcome, but please be aware that I'm far more likely to merge performance/ux improvements and bug fixes than new built-in chips or features. I do hope to provide some form of mod support in the future, but don't have any concrete plans for it right now. If you'd like to ask or discuss anything relating to development with me/others, check out [Discussions/Dev](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim/discussions/categories/dev).
